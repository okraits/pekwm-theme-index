# pekwm-theme-index
Repository acting as an index of pekwm themes hosted elsewhere.

Each theme in the index is represented by a JSON file under the
_themes_ directory.

The format of the JSON files is described in json-schema in
_theme.schema.json_.

# Getting your theme included

The process of getting your theme(s) included in the index includes
the following steps:

1. Fork pekwm-theme-index
2. Create .json files for your themes
3. Create a pull request

From that point, if the validation of the JSON file passes wait for
the pull request to be merged. After updates on the main branch of
pekwm-theme-index the [pekwm themes](https://www.pekwm.se/themes/)
site will be updated.
